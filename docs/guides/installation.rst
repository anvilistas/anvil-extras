Installation
============
Anvil-Extras is intended to be used as a dependency for other Anvil applications:

   * From the gear icon at the top of your app's left hand sidebar, select 'Dependencies'
   * In the buttons to the right of 'Add a dependency', click the 'Third Party' button
   * Enter the id of the Anvil-Extras app: C6ZZPAPN4YYF5NVJ=UGGCKFPRVZ7ELJH6RRZTHV6Y
   * Hit enter and ensure that the library appears in your list of dependencies
   * Select whether you wish to use the 'Development' or 'Published' version

For the published version, the dependency will be automatically updated as new versions are released.
On the development version, the update will occur whenever we merge new changes into the library's code base.
