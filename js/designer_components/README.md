# Let's create a Designer Component


## Intro

These notes are based on the internal tools developed by anvil-extras to make custom components dynamically update in the Anvil Designer.

**Can I do this in my own App without `anvil-extras`?**

Probably not.

**Should I do this in my own app?**

Probably not.


**I really want to make a Component that updates dynamically in the Designer?**

Don't do it.
It relies on TypeScript.
It plays around with Skulpt.
It's not officially supported.
It relies on Anvil implementation details that may change.
It will probably stop working at some point and need updating.

Oh and did I mention don't do it.


*Designer Components are isolated to the Designer, so if they do stop working - the actual Python Component won't be affected*.

### Overview

The custom component must be an HTMLPanel.
Anvil never calls the Python class in the Designer, so we create a Javascript version.
We inject the Javscript version in the html of the custom component inside script tags.
The Designer then uses our Javscript version whenever a property is updated.
We prevent the Javascript version loading in the real app by removing the script tags in our `__init__` method.
Since this happens before the Component is added to the screen the Javascript version never loads in actual Python.


## Where to start?

Write the Python version first!

When you want to create a Javascript version, first look at the comments in `DesignerComponent.ts`.
Anything marked as `private` should NOT be overridden.

- Does your Python class have injected `css`?
  - *override the `static css` property*
- Does your Python class have injected `link` tags?
  - *override the `static links` property*
- Does your Python class have injected `script` tags?
  - *override the `static scripts` property*


### `static init()`

You must override the `init()` method and then call `super.init()`

The custom component HTML must have a domNode with an identifiable selector.
e.g.

```html
<div class="quill-editor" style="min-height:150px;"></div>
```

The first argument to `super.init()` should be the selector to identify your custom component in the dom.
```typescript
    static init() {
        super.init(".quill-editor");
    }
```

An optional second argument can be used, which is a className. This className will be added to the HTMLPanel's domNode.
In the Designer world, its purpose is a flag to prevent instantiating the same domNode multiple times.
In practice the second argument can be used to add a class to the HTMLPanel that you would otherwise have added in your Python `__init__` method.

```typescript
    static init() {
        super.init(".tabs", "anvil-extras-tabs");
    }
```


### `constructor(domNode, pyComponent, el)`

A constructor function in Javascript is a bit like Python's `__init__` method and `this` acts like `self`.
After the `init` method is called we call the constructor.
There is no need to override the `constructor()` method - but you may want to if you want to add attributes to your `this` argument.
The arguments to the `constructor()` will be:
- the HTMLPanel's domNode for your custom component.
- the Python Component as a Skulpt object.
  (A Skulpt object is what your client-side Python object looks like in Javascript)
- the domNode of the element found from the querySelector used in the `init()` method


### `setProp(propName, propVal, props)`, `update(props, propName, propVal)`

You will need to override `setProp` or `update` (but not both).

In `setProp` you get the `propName` and the `propVal`, as well as all the current `props`.
These are the raw Javascript values.
You can either update the dom directly or work with the Skulpt Python objects.
There are some helper methods for common properties like `visible` and working with `color`.

The `DesignerChips` component is an example that uses `setProp` and works with both Skulpt objects and the dom to update itself when a property changes.

`update` is typically in place of `setProp` when you update your entire component whenever a property changes.
The advantage of `update` is that it is only called once on the first load, whereas `setProp` is called once per prop on the first load.


## Exporting your Designer class

To make your class available you need to export it in `js/designer_components/index.ts`

## Bundling the javascript
- Install deno
- `cd js/designer_components`
- `deno run -A build-script.ts`
- This will override the bundled files.



## Hacking

In each designer component, you'll see code like

```html
      <script type="module">

      import {DesignerQuill} from "https://deno.land/x/anvil_extras@dev-1.8.2/js/designer_components/bundle.min.js";

      DesignerQuill.init();

      </script>
```

You'll need equivalent code in your custom component's html.

When hacking, there's no need to worry about the deno link. Instead:
- bundle the Javascript (see above instructions)
- Copy the bundled file into your theme assets.
- Replace the deno URL with a relative theme URL: `./_/theme/bundle.js`

Whenever you change the local files, re-bundle and repeat.
